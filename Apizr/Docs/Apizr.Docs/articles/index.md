Apizr aims to provide a resilient and feature-rich web API client for .NET applications based on Refit, with the more resiliency we can, but without the boilerplate. 
It comes among other things with built-in support for retrying failed requests, handling network connectivity issues, caching responses, managing authentication, logging, and request prioritization, but there's more.
