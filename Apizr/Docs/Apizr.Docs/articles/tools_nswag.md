## NSwag

Apizr comes with a tool called Apizr.Tools.NSwag that offers to get all files generated by a couple of command lines.
It relies on the well known NSwag CLI, letting define all we need in a json configuration file, and generating models, services and a registration helper class.

Please first install the tool package:
